HEY YOU GUYS WHATS UP

so i lost my voice (because i'm dying) so i figured a video would be worthless

instead i made you guys this text file! get woo to read it out loud or
something, i know how much he likes to do impressions of me. 

SO MY PROGRAM WAS WRITTEN IN C

YES C

and it's a lot like java except not really because there are weird pointers 
involved?? it was pretty crazy. so in C you can have a variable yes all the
variables you want but you can ALSO HAVE POINTERS TO THESE VARIABLES

THEY POINT TO WHERE THEY ARE IN MEMORY??

IT'S ACTUALLY VERY CONFUSING but you tell the computer they're pointers by 
putting an asterisk (*) right before it, it's crazy

also there's no such thing as strings or booleans in C?? like what?? what even

if you want to make a string you have to call it an array of chars, this sucks

also booleans are stupid apparently so i just used 0s and 1s wow so l33t h4ck3r

So i thought i'd investigate how easy it is to make objects in C (spoiler alert:
IT'S NOT EASY AT ALL) by writing a program that lets you create a ball! and 
then you can torture it! fun for the whole family

someone should totally run my program for me :3 just double-click executableyay.exe
then start inputting stuff i guess, i normally put in 30 for the
radius, Blue for the color, and Hammurabi for the name.

The program itself is pretty self explanatory, i mean you just keep choosing 
what you want to do to the ball until you wanna quit 

I guess if you have questions you can text me?? 

Yeah have fun! Whoo finals time

Tara
